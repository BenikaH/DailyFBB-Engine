# DailyFBB-Engine 2.0

# NEW (3.20.16) - Bug Fixes:

1) Fixed Numberfire Crawler

2) Optimized lineup generator algorithm

3) Simplified Script to run as one file

4) Removed Excess files from repo

# Purpose

The Purpose of DailyFBB-Engine is to generate "the best lineup", or the lineup with the highest projected point output in a given day. 
The data powering this script is from numberfire (www.numberfire.com).

The current iteration of this script only works with numberfire data & fanduel (www.fanduel.com) pricing. Would love for collaborators to
help broaden the scope of this project. Refer to the bottom for contribution ideas - Would appreciate the help!

Hopefully this script can help set the best lineup without effort.
